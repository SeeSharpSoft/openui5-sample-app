Fragment:
- example of component definition in fragment (ugly)
- do not alter the assumption of the developer => no auto injected controller, but provide option to set controller explicitly

Settings:
- name/id the custom elements!
- thumb rule: ability to address an element in the model uniquely (compare with line item index issue)

TemplateModel:
- merge custom & existing already in model
- use templating only for dynamic content, e.g. fragment name

General:
- use JSON references while creating the model and resolve them before usage
